### Current focus
- Writing Python programs that handle real I/O, data flow, and failure cases  
- Understanding OS, DBMS, and process-level behavior through experiments  
- Building CLI-first tools before adding any UI  
- Learning ML from first principles (math → code → training loop)

---

### What I work on
- Backend logic and data pipelines
- Program structure and separation of concerns
- Debugging, tracing, and profiling
- Re-implementing basic ML models to understand training and optimization

---

### Projects
- **VisualGS**  
  CLI-based ground station for rocket telemetry  
  Features: packet parsing, CSV replay, health monitoring, plotting  
  Focus: structure, data flow, reproducibility

- **Systems experiments**  
  Shell scripts, file I/O, process behavior, syscall observation

- **ML fundamentals (scratch work)**  
  Linear regression, logistic regression, gradient descent implementations

---

### Tools I actually use
- Python
- Linux
- Git
- SQL (basics)
- FastAPI (backend understanding)
- Matplotlib
